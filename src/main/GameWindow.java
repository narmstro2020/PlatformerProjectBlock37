		// and implement its methods (it has 2)
		// But that's a bit wasteful.
		// So Java provides what is called an anonymous class.
		// TODO: note we can basically create our own single use class right here in the method
		// TODO: see below.  after new WindowFocusListener() we have curly's ???
		// TODO: yes because we need to implement the methods right here and right now.
		// TODO: the upsides is that I don't need a new file
		// TODO: the downsides are that I can't reuse this exact implementation.
		// TODO: anonymous class don't have constructors (cause they don't have names), cause they are
		// anonymous.
		// TODO: they don't have fields but since they are scoped in a method in a class they have access
		// to method local variables and class fields.
		// The variables they can access must be final or effectively final.
		// but that is okay since we only need one at the moment anyways.
